            "description": "This robot arm is (very) roughly styled as an 80% scaled version of the UR3 industrial robot. It uses the same design philosophy of simply placing a motor/reducer actuator unit at each joint, with six actuators stacked up to make a 6-axis arm. Now while the UR3 uses hollow torque motors coupled with harmonic drives ($$$) for the actuators, this robot uses the stepper motor/compound planetary actuators",
